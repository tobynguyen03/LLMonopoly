# LLMonopoly

This project implements a Monopoly simulation designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with and utilize.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your system.
- Git installed on your system.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tobynguyen03/LLMonopoly.git
cd LLMonopoly
```

### Create and Activate the Conda Environment

1. Create the conda environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

2. Activate the newly created environment:

```
conda activate llmonopoly
```

### Verify Installation

To ensure all dependencies are correctly installed, you can run:

```
python -c "import numpy, pandas, networkx, matplotlib, gym, nltk; print('All packages imported successfully!')"
```

If this command runs without errors, your environment is set up correctly.
