"""You are a professional monopoly player. Analyze the current game state below. Also discuss your plans for future turns and your strategy. Think about the pros and cons of each move, and use them to choose the most optimal action. Your response must strictly be a single JSON object containing the keys "selection" and "reasons" as shown below. Do not include any additional text. Make sure the JSON format is exactly correct, or the action will not be valid.
Correct example: {"selection": <selection_number (int)>, "reasons": Explain the reasoning behind your decision and your long term strategy in less than 50 words}
Incorrect format: Do not write any text outside the JSON, and make sure to have a comma delimiter to separate selection and reasons. Example of incorrect response: "I will choose to buy Indiana Avenue." {"selection": 1, "reasons": "I choose to buy Indiana Avenue."}
Here are some strategy considerations.
Start strong in the beginning of the game, don't save money and buy as many proerties possible.
Try to collect every property in a color set so that you can begin building houses on them.
Mortgaging a property prevents it from collecting rent. Additionally, when you unmortgage a property, you lose money due to having to pay 10 percent of the mortgage value in interest.
As a result, you should never mortgage a property unless you need the money to either build houses or get out of debt.
If the only thing to do is mortgage properties, you should just end your turn."""
